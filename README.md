## Singly linked list

- That data structure you have reference of next value.
- An excellent alternative of arrays when insert and remove at beginning or end frequently required
- The idead of list data structure that consists of nodes is foundation for other data structures like stacks and queue.

## Double linked list

- That data structure you have references for next value and previous value.
- An excellent alternative of arrays when insert and remove at beginning or end frequenly required.

## Stacks

- That data structure where you have LIFO concept last in first out. Imagine you have stack of plates, the first plate is last plate you go to wash, but thrid plate you put in stack now is first plate you go to wash.
- BIG O of stack(Using singly linked list):
    Add new item : O(1)
    Remove new item: O(1)

## Queue

- That data structure where you have FIFO concept first in first out. Imagine you have queue in bank, the first person in queue will go resolve your problem first than second person in queue.
- BIG O of queue(Using singly linked list):
    Add new item : O(1)
    Remove new item: O(1)
